# ICPP - Interactive Charts using Polymer and PHP 
This is my Last solo-jam for the course [IMT2581 - Rapid Prototyping and Innovation](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IMT2581/2018/1#tab=omEmnet) with the [IMT2291 - Web Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IMT2291#tab=omEmnet) course in mind.

## Note
This project is to show charts for the https://github.com/JohanAanesen/CSAMS databse contents

## Requirements
**The requirements was very loose, so I make my own**
* ~~Get top X users that has delivered the most~~ This dosen't work beacuse when a user re-deliver or withdraws an assignment and deliver again, the assignment will only be updated. i.e there will always be max one assignment submission for each user. 
* Get number of delivered submissions(re-deliver too) to the different assignments/courses
* Get number of 'active' users vs. non active. The users that don't belong to any courses
* Get most logged events

## Installation
1. Clone project in to `C:\xampp\htdocs`
2. Start xampp
